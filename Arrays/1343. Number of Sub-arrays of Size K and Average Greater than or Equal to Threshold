# Number of Subarrays of Size K and Average ≥ Threshold

## Problem
Given an integer array `arr`, an integer `k`, and an integer `threshold`, return the number of contiguous subarrays of size `k` whose **average is greater than or equal to `threshold`**.

## Key Idea
Use the **Sliding Window Technique** to efficiently calculate the sum of every subarray of size `k` and check its average.

## Approach (Optimal)
1. Compute the sum of the first `k` elements.
2. If `(sum / k) >= threshold`, increment the count.
3. Slide the window across the array:
   - Add the next element to the window.
   - Remove the element leaving the window.
4. For each new window, check if `(currentSum / k) >= threshold`.
5. Return the final count.

## Why It Works
- Sliding window avoids recomputing sums repeatedly.
- Each element is processed only once.
- Efficient for large arrays.

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the array.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), constant extra space.

## Important Note
- Integer division is sufficient since comparison is done with an integer threshold.
- Input array is not modified.

## Summary
This solution efficiently counts valid subarrays of size `k` using the sliding window technique with constant space.
